        <p class="fontsize2"> This is my Goldendoodle Harlym. She's about three years old, and she's my family's dog.
            She always has lots of energy, except for after she's been outside for a while. 
            Like any other dog, she begs for our food all the time and eats most anything. I don't think she's a fan of celery. 
            One time, I messed up a pizza in the oven and gave her some of it.
            Sometimes she sleeps in an upside down position in her cage she looks so silly! I googled it, and I believe it's because 
            she feels trusting of her environment. It also helps her to keep her body cooled off.

        <p class="fontsize2"> Our neighbor up the street, Becca, has a dog named Mochi. Him and Harlym are best friends.
           Becca takes Harlym and Mochi on walks sometimes and she's so kind for doing so.
           When we go on vacation, Becca is usually available to watch after harlym or take her on walks while we're away. 
           Harlym loves playing with Mochi and gets very excited, and jumpy when she sees him with Becca.
           Every now and then we might take Harlym to the dog park, though we haven't taken her in a while.
          She also used to go to doggy daycare during the week, which I think she quite liked.  </p>
