        <h2> The Moon </h2>

        <p class="fontsize2"> 
            The moon, Earth’s sole natural satellite, is our constant companion.
            It has circled our planet for billions of years, since before the first sparks of life flickered 
            in the oceans—before Earth was even cool enough to have oceans.
            It formed some 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system was in its infancy and comets, meteors, and asteroids 
            ricocheted throughout. 
            
           <h4> How Did the Moon Form? </h4>
           
           <p class="fontsize2"> One such collision, between Earth and a Mars-sized orb, likely flung molten rock out into space, 
            some of which coalesced and cooled to form what we now know as the moon. This early formation and close ties with young Earth 
            makes the moon one of the most promising places to explore the birth and development of our solar system and home planet. 
            The moon also preserves many of its ancient features: Unlike Earth, it doesn’t have plate tectonics to continually reface the 
            landscape, nor does it have wind and rain wearing down ancient rocks. </p>

        <h3> Can Humans live on the Moon? </h3>

        <p class="fontsize2"> To maintain a stable and safe habitat, you have to start by analysing the environment 
            in which you want to settle and knowing the constraints it will place on buildings and people. As the Moon
             is smaller than the Earth, its mass is lower. The Moon’s gravity is six times weaker than Earth’s: all the
             calculations for architecture, structures and material resistance must therefore be reviewed in depth.

             <p class="fontsize2">  In addition, the Moon has a very slow rotation. There, a day lasts about two Earth weeks, as does the night. 
            And without an atmosphere to homogenise the temperatures between the light and dark sides, 
            temperatures vary from 120°C during the day to ‑250°C at night! Not to mention that on the Moon, 
            meteoroids arrive intact and at full speed to the ground. 
            Several options have been studied to counteract these effects. One option is to use ancient lava tunnels just 
            below the Moon’s surface to build a protected environment, shielded from external conditions  </p>
