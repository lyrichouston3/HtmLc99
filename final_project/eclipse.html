        <h3> The Lunar Eclipse</h3>
        <p class="fontsize">  
        A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth’s shadow. 
        In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra.
        When the Moon is within the umbra, it will turn a reddish hue. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called “Blood Moons”
        because of this phenomenon. The more dust or clouds in Earth’s Atmosphere during the eclipse, the redder 
        the Moon will appear.

        <p class="fontsize"> To get the best view you'll need to be on the night side of Earth when one occurs, and you'll need a clear sky that's 
       free of clouds. No specialist equipment is needed. Try to minimise the light in your vicinity and, ideally, watch from a 
       spot where your line of sight won't be obstructed by tall buildings or trees.

        <h3> The Solar Eclipse</h3>
        <p class="fontsize">  
            A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth.
             When the Sun, Moon and Earth line up exactly, it causes a total eclipse. 
             This is because the diameter of the Sun is 400 times that of the Moon, but coincidentally it is also 400 times further away.

            </p>
            <p class="fontsize">  During an eclipse, the Moon temporarily covers the Sun, blocking out the daylight for a short period and casting a shadow on part of Earth. 
            There are two parts to this shadow: the umbra, where sunlight is blocked completely and a total eclipse is experienced, and the penumbra,
             where only some sunlight is blocked and a partial eclipse is experienced. A total solar eclipse spells a moment of near-complete darkness, 
             while partial eclipses are more like twilight.   </p>

             <p class="fontsize">  There are two to five solar eclipses each year, with a total eclipse taking place every 18 months or so. 
            Whether you can view that eclipse depends on where you are in the world.  </p>
