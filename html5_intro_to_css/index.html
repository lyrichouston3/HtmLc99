            <h2>What is Big Eyes?</h2>
            <p> A few years ago I saw a movie called Big Eyes. Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz starred in the film as Margaret and Walter Keane. 
            It is directed by Tim Burton and was released in 2014. It is set sometime in the 50s and 60s and tells the story of how artist Margaret Keane's art was put under her husband's name, Walter Keane. 
           He couldn't paint at all,but he was taking the credit for her paintings. He claimed that the paintings might not sell as well if people couldn't meet the artist that created them.
           By the end of the film, she sues him, she moves to Hawaii, and is revealed to the world that she is the real artist of the Big Eye art.

              <h3>My Thoughts on the Film</h3>
            <p> It's been years since I've seen the movie and I need to rewatch it! Ater watching it, I wanted to try to find an original piece of her artwork. They have 
                artwork that is original and also lithograph poster. I never really got around to purchasing a lithograph. One of the interesting things about the movie was the way 
                that the plot turned and the kind of greedy and sort of scary person that Walter was becoming. I also read most of the book that the movie is based on, it's titled Citizen Kane.
