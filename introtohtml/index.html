        <h1>Dinosaurs are cool!</h1>

        <hr>
        <p>Dinosaurs are kinda cool looking, I like them for their aesthetics. I don’t know that many Dinosaur facts. I’ve also never seen Jurassic park so I really need to do that. I saw part of one of the movies on a cruise ship, but that’s about it. Hopefully they make dinosaur vegan nuggets. I think they do but I don’t remember. You see, I’m not a dinosaur scholar but they’re still cool. What would our world be like today if dinosaurs still existed?</p>

        <h1>Did Dinosaurs Have Fur?</h1>



        <p>A newly identified species of dinosaur had some unusual features, including a long mane of fur down its back and stiff rod-like structures projecting from its shoulders.

            The dinosaur lived around 110 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. Dino Frey at the State Museum of Natural History in Karlsruhe, Germany, and his colleagues discovered the species while examining slabs of limestone from north-eastern Brazil.
            
            They took high resolution X-ray images of the slabs, which revealed the torso of an unknown species of dinosaur, measuring approximately 50 centimetres long.</p>
