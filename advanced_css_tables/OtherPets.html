                    <p class="fontsize2" >  My friend Jaden has a Miniature Pincher and her name is Chloe.
                    She is bit older than Harlym, maybe 10 years old?
                    She's a very sweet dog. Her body has just a little bit of a "build". 
                    My friend Sarah and I sometimes joke that Chloe gets really buff at the gym (⌐■_■).

                    <p class="fontsize2" >  This is Ren's dog, Koda. Koda is a Shiba Inu and he kinda looks like a fox. 
                    Ren brings Koda to work all the time, and he's a very adorable dog!
                    He doesn't get much work done, but he's still a great member on our team.
                    We like to play with him when we have downtime, and he loves chewing on his stuffed animal duck. </p>

                  This is a photo of a dog wearing sunglasses that a customer showed me at work.
                  I don't know what the dog's name is or how old it is.
                  I just think it's kind of funny that the dog could keep those sunglasses on.

                   Gabe has a Border Collie. This is not a photo of Gabe's Border Collie, but his looks similar to this one.
                   Poncho is a pretty dog and Gabe just got him a few months ago. Gabe also has three other pets.
                   He has a Bearded Dragon named Sammy, a cat named Pepper, and a second cat whose name consists of two curse words.
                   He also once tried to pickup a small tortoise from outside and take it in as a pet. That didn't last long 
                   and he eventually put it back outside.

        <p class="fontsize2"> 
      This is Michael's cat named Buddy. I don't know how old Buddy is. 
      If I remember correctly, Michael said that buddy can get himself
      into a bit of mischief. I think he's also said that buddy sometimes 
      tries to put his claws in Michael's nostrils.
