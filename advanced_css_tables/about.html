        <h2> The Origin of the Goldendoodle </h2>
        <p class="fontsize">  

            The original Goldendoodle was a hybrid cross of a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. 
            The exact date of conception is unknown as a handful of breeders emerged in the late 1990’s marketing this new breed.
            The idea was no doubt inspired by the creation of the Labradoodle and its success as a compatible dog for many people who experience mild allergies to dogs. 
            Goldendoodles are extremely social, outgoing, non-aggressive dogs that thrive on human companionship. 
            They have a great desire to please and to learn. Each individual breed (the Poodle and the Golden Retriever) score in the top 4 of the 150 smartest dog breeds.</p>

        <h3> Are Goldendoodles High Maintenance Dogs?</h3>
        <p class="fontsize">  
           
            What’s considered high maintenance to one person might not be to another, because there are many facets to 
            what it means to be a high- or low-maintenance breed. If you’re worried about spending hours every week cleaning 
            up dog hair, for instance, you’re in luck — doodles have non-shedding coats. However, that doesn’t mean your dog’s coat 
            won’t need plenty of attention. Daily brushing and frequent trips to a professional groomer will be in the cards.

            Compared to other dog breeds, doodles are excellent for first-time dog owners. Provided enough time is spent training them during the puppy stage, 
            they’re easy to train, adapt quickly and have a high capacity for love and attention. While this makes them great family dogs, their high energy levels
             and love of socializing means they should never be left alone for long periods of time.
